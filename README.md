# Nibbler
nake is a classical game from the 70’s. The simplicity of this addictive game resulted on its availability on most of existing game platforms under a form or another. For "old" people, Snake means hours and hours of slacking at school, using the mobile phone version of the Nokia 3310.

Nibbler is yet another snake video game written in C++ including a major twist: dynamic libraries. Through this project, you will discover the power and usefullness of dynamic libraries used at runtime. Your goal is splitted in 4 parts : a main executable and 3 dynamic libraries that your main executable will load and use at runtime. Each library will embed everything your main executable might need to display the game and to get the player’s inputs. The main executable will only focus on the game logic and interact with your dynamic libraries. The main executable must interact in a identical way with any of your libraries.
